  <h2>About Koby Wu </h2>
  <p>I am a 15 year old Chinese-Philipino girl living in Long Beach, California. I have one younger brother but he is actually taller than me ;(. 
    I wanted to attend Girls Who Code to help prepare myself next year in Computer Science class. </p>
  <h2> Fun Facts about me!</h2>
  <h6> I hate seafood. I just don't like the smell and the taste. It also may be because I always have wanted to be a marine biologist and care for marine animals. </h6>
  <h6>I am 4'8.5. Yeah I'm short </h6>
  <h6> I am a mother to 2 bunnies, Rae a white bunny and her mate Rocky a brown bunny.</h6>
