 <center> <p>Some similarities in Python and Scratch is that Scratch is like the dumb down version of Phython. Sractch has all the codes laid out for you while Python makes you write it all out. They just have different wordings for loops. It was hard learning Python since I am so used to HTML/CSS and the languages are so different. I like how python lets us use user input but it is really hard to remember how to format Python codes.</p> </center>

 <center> <p> A list is a where a group of items are connected into one group. It is very useful to use list if you want keep your items organized and seperating different items in diferent groups or lists. I liked the groups where we would have to figure out how to make a name generator. We all worked together to solve it even when we were all on different levels. I am very grateful for their help.</p></center>

 <center> <p> Before today I pictured a robot only being a machine that is made out of metal and has to be controlled by a human. I now know that many robots have sensors to be able to move on their own. I am excited to them to be able to help humans do hard tasks like taking down terrorist. However, I am nervous that they will one day take over all the jobs and the whole world. There might be a day where all we see are robots around us. </p></center>
